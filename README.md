# Keelstone Financial

A **fictional** B2B financial-services platform — global payments, treasury management, business lending, and corporate cards — built as a fullstack Next.js demo application. Nothing here is a real financial product; all companies, people, numbers, and claims are invented.

The site is intentionally feature-dense: 20 unique pages, each with its own interactive elements, backed by real API routes and an in-memory data store. It is designed to be used as a standalone playground / integration target for testing tooling against a realistic multi-page web app.

## Stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Hand-rolled SVG charts (no chart libraries)
- In-memory server-side data store (`lib/store.ts`) — data reseeds on every server restart, mutations persist while the server runs

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
